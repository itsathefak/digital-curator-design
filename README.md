# Art Gallery React Project

This is a simple React-based application designed as a virtual art gallery. The page showcases a collection of artworks, offering users an elegant and interactive interface to explore different art pieces. The gallery's design focuses on a clean, responsive, and visually appealing layout.

## Features

- **Responsive Design**: The gallery adapts to different screen sizes, making it suitable for both mobile and desktop devices.
- **Artwork Grid**: Art pieces are displayed in a grid layout, with hover effects for a more dynamic experience.
- **Interactive UI**: Users can interact with artworks for additional information or details.
- **Modern UI**: The interface has been crafted to give a sleek, modern feel to the art display.

## Technologies Used

- **React**: For building the user interface.
- **CSS**: For styling the layout and components.
- **JavaScript (ES6+)**: For creating interactive elements and handling events.
- **React Router** (optional): For future extensions, like a detailed view of individual artworks.
